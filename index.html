        <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Meg, and I am a former science teacher looking forward to changing careers into technology.
            I have been learning how to code on my own for the last 4 months, and am so excited to be a part of UT's Coding
            Bootcamp! "Everyone now knows how to find the meaning of life within himself. But mankind wasn't always so lucky.
            Less than a century ago men and women did not have easy access to the puzzle boxes within them. They could not
            name even one of the fifty-three portals to the soul. Gimcrack religions were big business. Mankind, ignorant
            of the truths that lie within every human being, looked outwardâ€”pushed ever outward. What mankind hoped to learn
            in its outward push was who was actually in charge of all creation, and what all creation was all about. Mankind
            flung its advance agents ever outward, ever outward. Eventually it flung them out into space, into the colorless,
            tasteless, weightless sea of outwardness without end."
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Besides my newfound interest in coding, I am a food fanatic - baking and cooking are some of my favorie things to
            do. I am also a gardener, with raised-bed vegetable gardens along with a few flower beds. I love hiking and camping,
            and hope to move to Colorado in the next few years.</p>
